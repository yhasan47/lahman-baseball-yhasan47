-- Different codes for Q1: 
SELECT MIN (yearid), MAX (yearid)
FROM batting

FROM pitching

SELECT MIN (yearid), MAX (yearid)
FROM fielding

SELECT MIN (yearid), MAX (yearid)
FROM appearances

SELECT MIN (yearid), MAX (yearid)

-- The following queries for Q1 gave the range from 1871 to 2017. 

SELECT MIN (debut), MAX(finalgame)
FROM people

SELECT MIN (debut), MAX(debut)

-- Aliasing for Q1:

SELECT MIN(yearid) AS start_year, MAX(yearid) AS end_year
FROM batting;

SELECT MIN(debut) AS start_date, MAX(finalgame) AS end_date
FROM people;


-- The query that Taylor used in class for Q1: 

SELECT MIN (min_year), MAX (max_year)
FROM (
